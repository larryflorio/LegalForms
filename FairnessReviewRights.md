## Fairness Review Rights  

**Fairness Review Right.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the [Investment Agreement/Certificate of Incorporation], the Company agrees that if, at any time, the Company or its affiliates enter into a transaction that would be subject to the entire fairness standard of review under Delaware law (including, but not limited to, transactions involving conflicts of interest between the Company and its controlling stockholders, directors, or officers), the Investor shall be entitled to a fairness review process consistent with the principles of Delaware law.  

In furtherance of this right, the Company shall:  

1. **Independent Review:** Engage an independent committee of disinterested directors (or, if no such committee exists, an independent third-party financial advisor) to evaluate the fairness of the transaction to the Company and its stockholders, including the Investor.  

2. **Disclosure:** Provide the Investor with reasonable prior notice of such a transaction and access to all material information provided to the independent committee or financial advisor evaluating the transaction.  

3. **Opinion Requirement:** If the transaction involves the purchase or sale of assets, securities, or any material related-party dealings, obtain an opinion from a nationally recognized financial advisor or valuation expert confirming the fairness of the transaction from a financial standpoint.  

4. **Consent Rights (if applicable):** If the Investor holds a certain threshold percentage of the Companyâ€™s securities (to be negotiated), require the affirmative consent of the Investor before proceeding with any transaction deemed to implicate entire fairness review standards.  

5. **Legal Remedies:** Ensure that any breach of this provision shall entitle the Investor to seek equitable relief, including specific performance, in addition to any other remedies available under applicable law.  

This provision shall remain in effect for so long as the Investor holds any securities in the Company and shall survive any amendments or modifications to the [Investment Agreement/Certificate of Incorporation] unless expressly waived in writing by the Investor.
